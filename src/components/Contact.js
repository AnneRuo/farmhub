      <h2>This is me, Anne Ruohonen</h2>

      <p>
        I am an application consultant, payroll and HR system key user and a
        helpdesk person. I am also passionate about learning new things. Two
        years ago on a whim I enrolled in a Python course and I was completely
        hooked after my first `&quot;`Hello, World`&quot;`.
      </p>
      <p>
        In two years, I have completed many courses, done my own projects and
        learned a lot about software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step is to start a new career as a developer and continue
        learning on the job.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can find my other projects on{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/AnneRuo?tab=repositories">GitHub</a> and get
        to know me and my skills better on my{' '}
